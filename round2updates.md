I have successfully implemented the three missing advanced concurrency features and reorganized the potentialEnhancements.json file as requested. Here's what was accomplished:

âœ… Completed Implementation
The three missing features from the original potentialEnhancements.json are now fully implemented:

Advanced concurrency controls (resource quotas, priority queues) - src/features/concurrencyManager.ts
Persistent query history storage - src/features/queryHistoryManager.ts
Query scheduling and queuing system - src/features/queryScheduler.ts
ðŸ“‹ Reorganized Enhancement Tracking
Updated potentialEnhancements.json with clear categorization:

ðŸ”´ Pending Enhancements (3 items)
Public API Exposure (High Priority)

Dependencies: All other enhancements should be completed first
Will expose the comprehensive API with all implemented features
Includes security controls and external agent support
Session and State Management (Medium Priority)

Will integrate with existing concurrency controls and history management
Multi-user/agent session support with state persistence
Security and Access Control (High Priority)

Should be implemented before or alongside Public API Exposure
Authentication, authorization, and enhanced sandboxing
ðŸŸ¡ Partially Implemented Enhancements (2 items)
- Enhanced Reasoning Features - N3/RDFS complete, missing CLP and probabilistic logic
- LSP and IDE Integration - Basic LSP features complete, missing full server implementation
ðŸŸ¢ Fully Implemented Enhancements (2 items)
- Batch and Asynchronous Requests - Complete with all advanced concurrency features
- Streaming and Pagination - Complete with efficient large result handling
ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Highlights
Comprehensive Integration: All new features are fully integrated into PrologBackend
Extensive Testing: test/advanced-concurrency.test.ts with 485 lines of comprehensive tests
Complete Documentation: docs/advanced-concurrency-features.md with usage examples and best practices
Backward Compatibility: All existing functionality remains unchanged

ðŸ”„ Next Steps Priority
You're absolutely correct that Public API Exposure should be implemented after the other enhancements are complete, as it will provide a comprehensive external API that exposes all the implemented features including:

Advanced concurrency controls with resource quotas
Persistent query history with filtering and statistics
Query scheduling with multiple execution types
Real-time WebSocket notifications
Streaming and pagination support
The reorganized structure now clearly shows the implementation roadmap with proper dependencies and priorities.
