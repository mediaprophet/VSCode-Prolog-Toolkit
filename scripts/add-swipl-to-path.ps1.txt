# SWI-Prolog Path Helper for Windows

This script helps you add SWI-Prolog (`swipl.exe`) to your system PATH so it can be used from any terminal or by VS Code extensions.

## Instructions

1. **Locate SWI-Prolog Installation:**
   - Default location: `C:\Program Files\swipl\bin`
   - If you installed elsewhere, find the folder containing `swipl.exe`.

2. **Run the Helper Script:**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator.
   - Run the following command, replacing the path if needed:

```powershell
$prologPath = "C:\Program Files\swipl\bin"
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";" + $prologPath, [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
Write-Host "SWI-Prolog path added to system PATH. Please restart VS Code and your terminal."
```

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a new PowerShell window.
   - Run: `swipl --version`
   - You should see the SWI-Prolog version output.

## Troubleshooting
- If you still get 'swipl' not recognized, double-check the path and repeat the steps.
- You may need to restart your computer for changes to take effect in all applications.
