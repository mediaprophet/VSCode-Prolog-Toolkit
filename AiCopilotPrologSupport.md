# AI Copilot Prolog Support

## Current Capabilities

The VSCode Prolog Toolkit provides a robust backend and chat-based interface that enables AI agents (such as GitHub Copilot or other LLM-based assistants) to perform logic programming tasks by interacting with a live SWI-Prolog process. The architecture supports the following capabilities:

### 1. Programmatic Prolog Requests
- The backend exposes a JSON-over-HTTP protocol for all Prolog operations.
- Agents can send requests for:
  - **Query execution**: Submit arbitrary Prolog goals and receive variable bindings, booleans, and error details.
  - **File consultation**: Load Prolog source files into the session.
  - **Help/documentation**: Retrieve documentation for predicates.
  - **N3/Turtle logic**: Load, list, reason, and explain semantic web data using N3 logic.
- All requests and responses are structured as JSON, making them easy to consume by AI agents.

### 2. Chat-Based Interaction
- The extension registers a chat participant (`@prolog`) in the VS Code chat panel.
- AI agents can issue chat commands (e.g., `/query`, `/consult`, `/help`, `/n3_load`, `/n3_reason`, `/n3_explain`) and receive formatted results.
- Results include Markdown-formatted tables, code blocks, and proof trees for easy rendering in chat UIs.

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- All input is validated and sanitized before being sent to Prolog.
- Errors are returned with structured codes and user guidance, allowing agents to handle failures gracefully.
- Timeouts and resource limits prevent runaway queries.

### 4. Extensible Protocol
- The backend is modular and can be extended to support new logic commands or custom protocols.
- Batch requests and future LSP integration are planned/possible.

## Example Agent Workflow

1. **Detect a logic task** (e.g., needs to check a property, infer a relationship, or solve a constraint).
2. **Formulate a Prolog query** and send it via the backend HTTP API or chat command.
3. **Receive structured results** (bindings, booleans, errors, or proof trees).
4. **Incorporate results** into the agent's reasoning or user-facing output.

## Current Limitations

- The backend is not exposed as a public HTTP API outside the VS Code extension process (agents must run within or communicate via the extension context).
- Only SWI-Prolog is supported (no ECLiPSe or Logtalk at present).
- No direct support for streaming very large result sets (pagination is available via chat commands).
- No authentication or multi-user session management (single-user, local context only).

## Potential Enhancements

1. **Public API Exposure**
   - Expose the backend HTTP API on a configurable port for external agents (with security controls).
   - Allow REST or WebSocket connections from trusted AI agents or tools.

2. **Batch and Asynchronous Requests**
   - Support batching of multiple logic queries in a single request.
   - Add async notification/callbacks for long-running queries.

3. **Streaming and Pagination**
   - Implement streaming of large result sets for queries with many solutions.
   - Add cursor-based pagination for chat and API responses.

4. **Session and State Management**
   - Support multiple concurrent sessions for different agents or users.
   - Allow agents to save and restore Prolog knowledge base state.

5. **Enhanced Reasoning Features**
   - Integrate constraint logic programming (CLP) and probabilistic logic support.
   - Add support for custom meta-interpreters or agent-defined logic modules.

6. **Security and Access Control**
   - Add authentication and authorization for API access.
   - Implement resource quotas and sandboxing for untrusted queries.

7. **LSP and IDE Integration**
   - Expose logic reasoning as a Language Server Protocol (LSP) feature for richer IDE/agent integration.

## Summary

The VSCode Prolog Toolkit provides a strong foundation for AI agents to leverage Prolog logic programming in real time. With further enhancements, it can become a general-purpose logic reasoning service for both IDE and external AI agent use cases.
