# Problem: Prolog Backend Handshake Fails Due to JSON Output Format

## Summary
The Node.js backend for the VS Code Prolog extension fails to complete its handshake with the SWI-Prolog server, resulting in all backend tests timing out. The root cause is a mismatch between the JSON output format produced by the Prolog server and the format expected by the backend.

## Symptoms
- All backend tests (e.g., `test/prologBackend.test.ts`) fail with a handshake timeout.
- The Prolog server outputs tagged dicts (e.g., `_11438{...}`) instead of plain JSON objects (`{...}`), even after attempts to patch the output logic.
- The backend logs show repeated handshake failures and timeouts.

## Files Involved
- `src/prolog_json_server.pl`: SWI-Prolog server, responsible for reading JSON requests and writing JSON responses. The `reply_json/1` predicate is intended to output plain JSON objects but currently outputs tagged dicts.
- `src/prologBackend.ts`: Node.js backend, spawns the Prolog server and expects plain JSON objects in response to requests. Fails to parse tagged dicts, resulting in handshake timeouts.
- `test/prologBackend.test.ts`: Mocha/Chai test suite for backend functionality. All tests fail due to the handshake issue.
- `test/run-with-logs.js`: Test runner script, automates test execution and log generation.

## Technical Details
- The Prolog server uses `json_write_dict/3` with `[tag(false)]` to attempt to output plain JSON objects. However, if the dict tag is not `user` or omitted, SWI-Prolog still outputs a tagged dict.
- Debug output in the Prolog server shows tagged dicts being written, indicating the tag is not being properly removed.
- The backend expects a response like `{ "id": ..., "status": "ok", ... }` but receives `_11438{...}` or similar, causing JSON parsing to fail.

## Attempts to Fix
- Multiple patches to `reply_json/1` to force the dict tag to `user` and use `json_write_dict/3` with `[tag(false)]`.
- Manual tests and documentation review confirm that only dicts with the `user` tag or no tag are output as plain JSON objects.
- The problem persists, suggesting either the tag is not being set correctly or the backend is not reading the output as expected.

## Next Steps
- Manually run the Prolog server, send a JSON request, and capture the exact output to confirm the format.
- If the output is correct, review the backend's reading/parsing logic for issues.
- If the output is still tagged, further adjust the Prolog code to ensure the tag is set to `user` or omitted before writing JSON.
