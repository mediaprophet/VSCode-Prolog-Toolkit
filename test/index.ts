// This file is providing the test runner to use when running extension tests.
// By default the test runner in use is Mocha based.
//
// You can provide your own test runner if you want to override it by exporting
// a function run(testRoot: string, clb: (error:Error) => void) that the extension
// host can call to run the tests. The test runner is expected to use console.log
// to report the results back to the caller. When the tests are finished, return
// a possible error to the callback or null if none.

// Mocha test runner setup for ESM
